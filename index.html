<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I'm one of those people who can't walk down the street without noticing what kinds of locks are installed on the nearby buildings, and more importantly if they were installed correctly. I've been living with my "condition" long enough to know that most security is as good as it needs to be, the shop is more concerned with smash-n-grabs than the threat of a master locksmith turned burglar. However, if you're reading this page you probably aren't satisfied with the bare minimum. If you need someone with a wide range of experience and the right mindset to keep your organization protected, contact me.</p>
